# XenoTools
 A very simple Discord bot that helps with network focused utilities, created in [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and is easy to configure.

# Prerequisite
 1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
 2. Prior knowledge of JavaScript. It literally is a "fill in the blank and your good to go" type of bot, but if you get errors, that's on you bud.
 3. A Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

# Configuration
 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to set this bot up.

 **Steps:**
 1. Change ``example.env`` to ``.env``.
 2. Start filling out the information inside of the configuration file. If you don't, you bot won't run properly. Your Discord token is the token you get from your application dashboard.
 3. The client ID is the client of the bot that is running. This is for the invite command.
 3. Run the following commands:
 ```js
npm install
node index.js
 ```
 4. Your good to go! Now you setup this bot, your all done.
